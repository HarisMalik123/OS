# A* algorithm with the help of multithreading 
This project aims to implement the A* algorithm using multithreading to enhance its performance for pathfinding in large graphs. The goal is to optimize the algorithm to run more efficiently by leveraging concurrent processing.

Algorithm Description
The A* algorithm is a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node using heuristics to prioritize exploration. By integrating multithreading, the algorithm can process multiple nodes simultaneously, reducing computation time.
